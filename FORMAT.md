### Inkstone Custom List Format

Inkstone custom lists are tab-separated files with one row per word and
with four columns per row:

1. The word in simplified characters
2. The word in traditional characters
3. The word's pronunciation, in numbered pinyin
4. The word's definition

Here are some tips for writing numbered pinyin:
- Use "v" for "ü".
  For example, write 女人 ("nǚrén") as "nv3ren2".
- Use "5" as the number for a toneless syllable.
  For example, write 我们 ("wŏmen") as "wo3men5".
- Add spaces between syllables when appropriate.
  For example, write 不客气 (bú kèqì) as "bu2 ke4qi4".

Finally, lines beginning with "//" are treated as comments and ignored.
