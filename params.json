To build this app,\r\n[install the latest version of Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/install),\r\nthen check out this repository and run:\r\n\r\n    $ meteor build output --server localhost:3785\r\n\r\nThe `--server` parameter in this build command is a dummy: this app is an\r\nentirely client-side app. That means that you can study Chinese on the go\r\nwithout any Internet connection!\r\n\r\n### Supported platforms\r\n\r\nThis app is currently Android-only. After running the build command\r\nabove, you'll find two .apk files in the output directory, one for armv7\r\nphones and the other for x86 phones. Look for the files in:\r\n\r\n    output/inkstone/android/project/build/outputs/apk/\r\n\r\nIn theory, the code in this repository can be used to build an iOS app,\r\ntoo, as follows:\r\n\r\n    $ meteor add-platform ios\r\n    $ meteor build output --server localhost:3785\r\n\r\nHowever, I can't test or debug the iOS build because I don't have an\r\niPhone. If people are interested, I'd love to buy one and try it out!\r\nApple devices are expensive, though, as are Apple developer licenses...\r\n\r\n### Pre-built binaries\r\n\r\nI've uploaded copies of the Android binaries to Dropbox. Only use these\r\nbinaries if you trust me and Dropbox! The legal disclaimers in the\r\n`LICENSE` file apply to these binaries as well: **there is no warranty\r\nfor this program, to the extent permitted by applicable law**. See that\r\nfile for full details. With those caveats stated, the pre-built\r\nbinaries are here:\r\n\r\n- [Inkstone for Android armv7](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z2avjvqclmj2snd/inkstone-armv7.apk?dl=0)\r\n- [Inkstone for Android x86](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ucm7zrwuwmeioy6/inkstone-x86.apk?dl=0)\r\n\r\n### Upcoming features\r\n\r\nRight now, Inkstone only supports simplified characters. Adding an option\r\nto study traditional characters is on the roadmap, as are a number of\r\nother significant new features - see `todo.txt` for a list. If there's\r\nsomething you'd like to see added that's not in that file, open an issue\r\nor drop me an email at `kshaunak \"at\" gmail.com`.",
