  "body": "### Inkstone Custom List Format\r\n\r\nInkstone custom lists are tab-separated files with one row per word and\r\nwith four columns per row:\r\n\r\n1. The word in simplified characters\r\n2. The word in traditional characters\r\n3. The word's pronunciation, in numbered pinyin\r\n4. The word's definition\r\n\r\nHere are some tips for writing numbered pinyin:\r\n- Use \"v\" for \"ü\".\r\n  For example, write 女人 (\"nǚrén\") as \"nv3ren2\".\r\n- Use \"5\" as the number for a toneless syllable.\r\n  For example, write 我们 (\"wŏmen\") as \"wo3men5\".\r\n- Add spaces between syllables when appropriate.\r\n  For example, write 不客气 (bú kèqì) as \"bu2 ke4qi4\".\r\n\r\nFinally, lines beginning with \"//\" are treated as comments and ignored.\r\n\r\n[See an example list in this format.](\r\nhttps://skishore.github.io/inkstone/lists/Beginner Chinese/Lessons 1-4.list)",
