If you don't see it there, you're at version 0.0.4\r\nor earlier.\r\n\r\n- Version 0.0.7 makes it\r\n  [easier to import word lists](https://skishore.github.io/inkstone/docs/format.html).\r\n- Version 0.0.6 makes it possible to adjust scheduling settings freely.\r\n- Version 0.0.5 includes the option to **study traditional characters**.\r\n\r\nSee the [Installing from binary](#installing-from-binary)\r\nsection for updated APKs.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nInkstone is a mobile app for people who want to learn to read and\r\nwrite Mandarin. It's **totally free**, **open-source**, and can be used\r\n**without an Internet connection**! Inkstone is licensed under the\r\n[GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).\r\nAlthough the app is still being developed, it has quite a few features:\r\n\r\n- Tap for a hint, double-tap for a walkthrough\r\n- Stroke recognition and automatic grading\r\n- Spaced-repetition-based scheduling\r\n- Help pages and stroke-order animations for every character\r\n- Bundled word lists: radicals and all HSK levels\r\n- Settings that give you control over scheduling\r\n- Support for custom word lists\r\n\r\nInkstone should run on both Android and iOS, but I don't have an iPhone\r\non which to test the iOS version. See the `Supported platforms` section\r\nfor details.\r\n\r\n### Installing from binary\r\n\r\nI've uploaded compiled Android APKs to Dropbox. Only use these\r\nbinaries if you trust me and Dropbox! The legal disclaimers in the\r\n`LICENSE` file apply to these binaries as well: **there is no warranty\r\nfor this program, to the extent permitted by applicable law**. See that\r\nfile for full details. With those caveats stated, the pre-built\r\nbinaries are here:\r\n\r\n- [Inkstone v. 0.0.7 for Android armv7](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z2avjvqclmj2snd/inkstone-armv7.apk?dl=1)\r\n- [Inkstone v. 0.0.7 for Android x86](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ucm7zrwuwmeioy6/inkstone-x86.apk?dl=1)\r\n\r\nMost Android phones use armv7. Trying to install the APK for the wrong\r\narchitecture will just result in an error message, so if you're not sure\r\nwhich one your phone is, try both.\r\n\r\n### Building from source\r\n\r\nTo build Inkstone,\r\n[install the latest version of Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/install),\r\nthen check out this repository and run:\r\n\r\n    $ meteor build .build --server localhost:3785\r\n    $ cp -R cordova-build-override/* .build/android/project/assets/.\r\n    $ pushd .build/android/project/cordova\r\n    $ ./build --release\r\n    $ popd\r\n\r\nIf the build goes successfully, you'll end up with APKs in:\r\n\r\n    ./build/android/project/build/outputs/apk/\r\n\r\nYou'll have to sign these APKs before they can be installed on a device.\r\nSee `scripts/build` for an example that also signs the APKs.\r\nNote that the `--server` parameter in the `meteor build` command is a dummy.\r\nOther than custom-lists downloads, the app is an entirely-client-side app.\r\n\r\n### Supported platforms\r\n\r\nThis app has only been tested on Android. In theory, this code could\r\nbe used to build an iOS app, too, as follows:\r\n\r\n    $ meteor add-platform ios\r\n    $ meteor build .build --server localhost:3785\r\n\r\nHowever, I can't test or debug the iOS build because I don't have an\r\niPhone. If people are interested, I'd love to buy one and try it out!\r\nApple devices are expensive, though, as are Apple developer licenses...\r\n\r\n### Upcoming features\r\n\r\nSee `todo.txt` for a list of planned features. If there's something you'd\r\nlike to see added that's not in that file, open an issue or drop me an email\r\nat `kshaunak \"at\" gmail.com`.\r\n",
